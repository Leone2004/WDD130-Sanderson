<h2>Why Rings Matter</h2>
    <section id="stories"><p>
Stories: Like we stated above, rings have the potential to tell an infinite number of unique stories.
    Two of the same rings can tell two different stories for two different people. That's what makes 
    them so special. They are applicable to everyone bar none.</p>
<p>
Love: Should you be looking for or have already found your significant other, then a wedding band would be
    perfect for you. From diamonds to sapphire, there are many ways to show your devotion to the one you love
    through even the simplest of rings. Each wedding band carries with it deep sentiment and the stones we
    choose to adore them with are just one more lasting testimony to this devotion.
</p>
<p>
Achievement: All of us have achievements which are very dear to us. Whether it be winning a state
    championship, learning to play an instrument or doing something you never thought possible. What better
    way to remember this event than through a ring. Thanks to the variety that they come in you can get it 
    fitted to any need that you may have to represent your achievement.
</p>
<p>
Identity: Once again, thanks to the variety of rings that exist they are a perfect way to express and 
    explore your identity. Whether you want an extravagant band, or something simple and easy to miss, there 
    is still a ring for your needs. If you're looking to express your love of nature, or animals or even music,
    there are rings to help express all these things.
</p>
<p>
Tradition: Finally, there is tradition. This could easily be one of the largest factors when deciding 
    on a ring to fit your personal needs and interests. Rings are perfect for displaying a mantra to help you 
    remember a purpose. Or maybe they play a part of your culture. Either way it serves as a great reminder not 
    only to you but also to those close to you.</p>
